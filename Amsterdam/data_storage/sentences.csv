17	19	The investitures of Queens Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix also took place there	17	en
18	20	After the Oude Kerk (.Old Church.) grew too small for the expanding population of the town, the bishop of Utrecht gave permission to build a second parish church, the Nieuwe Kerk (.New Church.)	17	en

20	22	This new church was consecrated in 1409[3] to St Mary and St Catharine, and the first services were held in 1410	17	en
21	23	The church was damaged by the city fires of 1421 and 1452 and burned down almost entirely in 1645, after which it was rebuilt in Gothic[1] style	17	en
22	24	In 1578 the building became a Dutch Reformed church	17	en
23	25	It underwent major renovation in 1892–1914, which added many neo-Gothic details and was again renovated in 1959–80	17	en
24	26	The second renovation proved expensive for the Dutch Reformed Church, forcing the church to be closed most of the time in order to save money on maintenance	17	en

28	30	The building was founded circa 1213 and consecrated in 1306 by the bishop of Utrecht with Saint Nicolas as its patron saint	18	en
29	31	After the Reformation in 1578, it became a Calvinist church, which it remains today	18	en
30	32	It stands in De Wallen, now Amsterdam's main red-light district	18	en

34	36	The church has seen several renovations performed by 15 generations of Amsterdam citizens	18	en
35	37	The church stood for only a half-century before the first alterations were made	18	en

45	48	It stands on the busy Muntplein square, where the Amstel river and the Singel canal meet, near the flower market and the eastern end of the Kalverstraat shopping street	19	en
46	49	The tower was originally part of the Regulierspoort, one of the main gates in Amsterdam's medieval city wall	19	en
47	50	The gate, built in the year 1480 consisted of two towers and a guard house	19	en
48	51	After the gate went up in flames in a 1618 fire, only the guard house and part of the western tower remained standing	19	en
49	52	The tower was then rebuilt in Amsterdam Renaissance style in 1620, with an eight-sided top half and elegant open spire designed by Hendrick de Keyser, featuring a clockwork with four clockfaces and a carillon of bells	19	en

52	55	The present guard house is not the original medieval structure but a 19th-century fantasy	19	en
53	56	The original guard house, which had survived the fire of 1618 relatively unscathed, was replaced with a new building during 1885-1887 in Neo-Renaissance style	19	en
