       "['Nieuwe Kerk ( New Church ) is a 15th-century church in Amsterdam located on Dam Square, next to the Royal Palace. Formerly a Dutch Reformed Church parish, it now belongs to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. The Nieuwe Kerk is no longer used for church services but is used as an exhibition space. It is also used for organ recitals. There is a café in one of the buildings attached to the church that has an entrance to the church (during opening hours). There is a museum store inside the entrance that sells postcards, books, and gifts having to do with the church and its exhibitions. The church is used for Dutch royal investiture ceremonies (as per Article 32 of the Dutch Constitution) most recently that of King Willem-Alexander in 2013, as well as royal weddings, most recently the wedding of Willem-Alexander to Máxima in 2002. The investitures of Queens Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix also took place there. After the Oude Kerk (.Old Church.) grew too small for the expanding population of the town, the bishop of Utrecht gave permission to build a second parish church, the Nieuwe Kerk (.New Church.). Construction on began in 1380 and finished in 1408. This new church was consecrated in 1409[3] to St Mary and St Catharine, and the first services were held in 1410. The church was damaged by the city fires of 1421 and 1452 and burned down almost entirely in 1645, after which it was rebuilt in Gothic[1] style. In 1578 the building became a Dutch Reformed church. It underwent major renovation in 1892–1914, which added many neo-Gothic details and was again renovated in 1959–80. The second renovation proved expensive for the Dutch Reformed Church, forcing the church to be closed most of the time in order to save money on maintenance. To keep the church open, ownership was transferred in 1979 to a newly formed cultural foundation called the Nationale Stichting De Nieuwe Kerk..

After the Reformation in 1578, it became a Calvinist church, which it remains today. It stands in De Wallen, now Amsterdam's main red-light district. The square surrounding the church is the Oudekerksplein. By around 1213, a wooden chapel had been erected at the location of today's Oude Kerk. Over time, this structure was replaced by a stone church that was consecrated in 1306. The church has seen several renovations performed by 15 generations of Amsterdam citizens. The church stood for only a half-century before the first alterations were made. the aisles were lengthened and wrapped around the choir in a half circle to support the structure. Not long after the turn of the 15th century, north and south transepts were added to the church creating a cross formation. Work on these renovations was completed in 1460, though it is likely that progress was largely interrupted by the great fires that besieged the city in 1421 and 1452. This delayed the building for almost 1 year. Before the Alteratie, or Reformation in Amsterdam of 1578, the Oude Kerk was Roman Catholic. Throughout the 16th-century battles, the church was looted and defaced on numerous occasions, first in the Beeldenstorm of 1566, when a mob destroyed most of the church art and fittings, including an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck.

       " \"The Munttoren (.Mint Tower.) or Munt is a tower in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It stands on the busy Muntplein square, where the Amstel river and the Singel canal meet, near the flower market and the eastern end of the Kalverstraat shopping street. The tower was originally part of the Regulierspoort, one of the main gates in Amsterdam's medieval city wall. The gate, built in the year 1480 consisted of two towers and a guard house. After the gate went up in flames in a 1618 fire, only the guard house and part of the western tower remained standing. The tower was then rebuilt in Amsterdam Renaissance style in 1620, with an eight-sided top half and elegant open spire designed by Hendrick de Keyser, featuring a clockwork with four clockfaces and a carillon of bells. The name of the tower refers to the fact that the guard house on side of it was used to mint coins in the 17th Century. In the Rampjaar (.disastrous year.) of 1672, when both England and France declared war on the Dutch Republic and French troops occupied much of the country, silver and gold could no longer be safely transported to Dordrecht and Enkhuizen (where coins were normally minted), so the guard house of the Munttoren was temporarily used to mint coin. The present guard house is not the original medieval structure but a 19th-century fantasy. The original guard house, which had survived the fire of 1618 relatively unscathed, was replaced with a new building during 1885-1887 in Neo-Renaissance style. The architect was Willem Springer An underpass between the tower and the building was made during the 1938-1939 renovation. The Munttoren received new extra foundations to prevent it from sagging during construction of the Noord/Zuidlijn, the new metro line..

       " \"City trip In Amsterdam - July 2021 - Moco Museum   We Are Moco  The Moco Museum focuses on proven artists with a unique vision. The Moco Museum in Amsterdam is a boutique museum with a wide range of inspiring modern and contemporary art. With artists like Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, JR, KAWS, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol, and more, we offer visitors an unparalleled collection of subversive art in which irony and humor are used to reflect on modern society. A one-of-a-kind experience aimed at a wide audience, a visit to Moco is a true eye-opener. Reflecting Forward expresses endless connections to reveal what the future can look like. Studio Irma x Moco introduces Connectivism as a new art movement. Through compassion and empathy, we arrive at a shared understanding. So, in our collective choice to experience this digital immersive art exhibition, we are Reflecting Forward in search of Connectivism. Brightly colored lights, movement, and music drive you through these interactive, digital spaces: Diamond Matrix, Kaleidoscope, We All Live in Bubbles, Connect the Dots. Connectivism stresses that internet technologies like web browsers, search engines, and social media contribute to new ways of understanding and learning in our digital age. A mysterious British artist known for his humorous and political street art. The Banksy exhibition at Moco contains several of his infamous street pieces, as well a large number of his indoor works, including work on canvas. One of these is his giant 'Beanfield' painting, a beautiful piece that is displayed on the ground floor. An impossible-to-miss eye-catcher as you enter the Banksy exhibition. Other highlights include 'Girl with Balloon', 'Laugh Now' and 'Keep It Real'. The Banksy collection at Moco Museum: come check it out. The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience. There is one small drawback, though: charming as the building is, its compact size does mean it can feel crowded during peak hours. The Moco Museum is a private initiative of Lionel and Kim Logchies. The exhibited works of art are on loan from their carefully cultivated international network of art collectors.

The Moco Museum in Amsterdam is a boutique museum with a wide range of inspiring modern and contemporary art. With artists like Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, JR, KAWS, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol, and more, we offer visitors an unparalleled collection of subversive art in which irony and humor are used to reflect on modern society. A one-of-a-kind experience aimed at a wide audience, a visit to Moco is a true eye-opener. Reflecting Forward expresses endless connections to reveal what the future can look like. Studio Irma x Moco introduces Connectivism as a new art movement. Through compassion and empathy, we arrive at a shared understanding. So, in our collective choice to experience this digital immersive art exhibition, we are Reflecting Forward in search of Connectivism.

A mysterious British artist known for his humorous and political street art. The Banksy exhibition at Moco contains several of his infamous street pieces, as well a large number of his indoor works, including work on canvas. One of these is his giant 'Beanfield' painting, a beautiful piece that is displayed on the ground floor. An impossible-to-miss eye-catcher as you enter the Banksy exhibition. Other highlights include 'Girl with Balloon', 'Laugh Now' and 'Keep It Real'. The Banksy collection at Moco Museum: come check it out. The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience. There is one small drawback, though: charming as the building is, its compact size does mean it can feel crowded during peak hours. The Moco Museum is a private initiative of Lionel and Kim Logchies. The exhibited works of art are on loan from their carefully cultivated international network of art collectors. Part of the proceeds from the museum will be donated to charities that are close to the hearts of the initiators. ( A little city trip in Amsterdam Un petit city trip a Amsterdam ).

       " \"City trip In Amsterdam - July 2021 - Moco Museum   We Are Moco  The Moco Museum focuses on proven artists with a unique vision. The Moco Museum in Amsterdam is a boutique museum with a wide range of inspiring modern and contemporary art. With artists like Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, JR, KAWS, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol, and more, we offer visitors an unparalleled collection of subversive art in which irony and humor are used to reflect on modern society. A one-of-a-kind experience aimed at a wide audience, a visit to Moco is a true eye-opener. Reflecting Forward expresses endless connections to reveal what the future can look like. Studio Irma x Moco introduces Connectivism as a new art movement. Through compassion and empathy, we arrive at a shared understanding. So, in our collective choice to experience this digital immersive art exhibition, we are Reflecting Forward in search of Connectivism. Brightly colored lights, movement, and music drive you through these interactive, digital spaces: Diamond Matrix, Kaleidoscope, We All Live in Bubbles, Connect the Dots. Connectivism stresses that internet technologies like web browsers, search engines, and social media contribute to new ways of understanding and learning in our digital age. A mysterious British artist known for his humorous and political street art. The Banksy exhibition at Moco contains several of his infamous street pieces, as well a large number of his indoor works, including work on canvas. One of these is his giant 'Beanfield' painting, a beautiful piece that is displayed on the ground floor. An impossible-to-miss eye-catcher as you enter the Banksy exhibition. Other highlights include 'Girl with Balloon', 'Laugh Now' and 'Keep It Real'. The Banksy collection at Moco Museum: come check it out. The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience. There is one small drawback, though: charming as the building is, its compact size does mean it can feel crowded during peak hours. The Moco Museum is a private initiative of Lionel and Kim Logchies. The exhibited works of art are on loan from their carefully cultivated international network of art collectors. Part of the proceeds from the museum will be donated to charities that are close to the hearts of the initiators. ( A little city trip in Amsterdam Un petit city trip a Amsterdam ).

A mysterious British artist known for his humorous and political street art.

The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience.

Part of the proceeds from the museum will be donated to charities that are close to the hearts of the initiators. ( A little city trip in Amsterdam Un petit city trip a Amsterdam ).

The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience. There is one small drawback, though: charming as the building is, its compact size does mean it can feel crowded during peak hours. The Moco Museum is a private initiative of Lionel and Kim Logchies. The exhibited works of art are on loan from their carefully cultivated international network of art collectors. Part of the proceeds from the museum will be donated to charities that are close to the hearts of the initiators. ( A little city trip in Amsterdam Un petit city trip a Amsterdam ).

       " \"City trip In Amsterdam - July 2021 - Moco Museum   We Are Moco  The Moco Museum focuses on proven artists with a unique vision. The Moco Museum in Amsterdam is a boutique museum with a wide range of inspiring modern and contemporary art. With artists like Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, JR, KAWS, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol, and more, we offer visitors an unparalleled collection of subversive art in which irony and humor are used to reflect on modern society. A one-of-a-kind experience aimed at a wide audience, a visit to Moco is a true eye-opener. Reflecting Forward expresses endless connections to reveal what the future can look like. Studio Irma x Moco introduces Connectivism as a new art movement. Through compassion and empathy, we arrive at a shared understanding. So, in our collective choice to experience this digital immersive art exhibition, we are Reflecting Forward in search of Connectivism. Brightly colored lights, movement, and music drive you through these interactive, digital spaces: Diamond Matrix, Kaleidoscope, We All Live in Bubbles, Connect the Dots. Connectivism stresses that internet technologies like web browsers, search engines, and social media contribute to new ways of understanding and learning in our digital age. A mysterious British artist known for his humorous and political street art. The Banksy exhibition at Moco contains several of his infamous street pieces, as well a large number of his indoor works, including work on canvas. One of these is his giant 'Beanfield' painting, a beautiful piece that is displayed on the ground floor. An impossible-to-miss eye-catcher as you enter the Banksy exhibition. Other highlights include 'Girl with Balloon', 'Laugh Now' and 'Keep It Real'. The Banksy collection at Moco Museum: come check it out. The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience. There is one small drawback, though: charming as the building is, its compact size does mean it can feel crowded during peak hours. The Moco Museum is a private initiative of Lionel and Kim Logchies. The exhibited works of art are on loan from their carefully cultivated international network of art collectors. Part of the proceeds from the museum will be donated to charities that are close to the hearts of the initiators. ( A little city trip in Amsterdam Un petit city trip a Amsterdam ).

The Moco Museum in Amsterdam is a boutique museum with a wide range of inspiring modern and contemporary art. With artists like Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, JR, KAWS, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol, and more, we offer visitors an unparalleled collection of subversive art in which irony and humor are used to reflect on modern society. A one-of-a-kind experience aimed at a wide audience, a visit to Moco is a true eye-opener. Reflecting Forward expresses endless connections to reveal what the future can look like. Studio Irma x Moco introduces Connectivism as a new art movement. Through compassion and empathy, we arrive at a shared understanding. So, in our collective choice to experience this digital immersive art exhibition, we are Reflecting Forward in search of Connectivism. Brightly colored lights, movement, and music drive you through these interactive, digital spaces: Diamond Matrix, Kaleidoscope, We All Live in Bubbles, Connect the Dots.

A mysterious British artist known for his humorous and political street art. The Banksy exhibition at Moco contains several of his infamous street pieces, as well a large number of his indoor works, including work on canvas. One of these is his giant 'Beanfield' painting, a beautiful piece that is displayed on the ground floor. An impossible-to-miss eye-catcher as you enter the Banksy exhibition. Other highlights include 'Girl with Balloon', 'Laugh Now' and 'Keep It Real'. The Banksy collection at Moco Museum: come check it out. The Modern Contemporary (Moco) Museum has made its home in Villa Alsberg, a townhouse overlooking Museumplein in the heart of Amsterdam. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers who designed Amsterdam's Central Station and the Rijksmuseum, which is at the opposite end of the square. This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm. No effort is spared to ensure that this breathtaking mansion makes an impact on visitors, adding an extra layer to the Moco experience. There is one small drawback, though: charming as the building is, its compact size does mean it can feel crowded during peak hours. The Moco Museum is a private initiative of Lionel and Kim Logchies.

The building was founded circa 1213 and consecrated in 1306 by the bishop of Utrecht with Saint Nicolas as its patron saint. After the Reformation in 1578, it became a Calvinist church, which it remains today. The square surrounding the church is the Oudekerksplein. By around 1213, a wooden chapel had been erected at the location of today's Oude Kerk. Over time, this structure was replaced by a stone church that was consecrated in 1306. The church has seen several renovations performed by 15 generations of Amsterdam citizens. The church stood for only a half-century before the first alterations were made. the aisles were lengthened and wrapped around the choir in a half circle to support the structure. Not long after the turn of the 15th century, north and south transepts were added to the church creating a cross formation. Work on these renovations was completed in 1460, though it is likely that progress was largely interrupted by the great fires that besieged the city in 1421 and 1452. This delayed the building for almost 1 year. Before the Alteratie, or Reformation in Amsterdam of 1578, the Oude Kerk was Roman Catholic. Throughout the 16th-century battles, the church was looted and defaced on numerous occasions, first in the Beeldenstorm of 1566, when a mob destroyed most of the church art and fittings, including an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck.
