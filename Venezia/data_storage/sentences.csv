297	355	A skeletal floor for the ESA-supported lunar habitat design which was created by leading architects Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and currently on show at this year’s Venice Biennale	923	en
298	356	This prototype floor design section was 3D printed in stainless steel by Dutch company MX3D, famous for creating a 3D-printed bridge in Amsterdam	923	en
299	357	Designed to meet efficiency, use, and construction constraints, the structure’s smooth web pattern design emerged from delineating stress map analysis and optimising a continuous topology to reduce mass and make maximum use of 3D printing manufacturing methods	923	en
300	358	It was printed using robotic ‘wire arc additive manufacturing’ out of 308LSi stainless steel and took about 246 hours to make, adding up to a total mass of approximately 395 kg	923	en
301	359	The overall floor design is made out of six separate segments that were printed vertically before being welded together	923	en
302	360	The 3D printed structure is supported by three columns and hosts a series of floor panels	923	en
303	361	The innovative floor design is supported from columns in the habitat walls, cantilevering towards the perimeter and centre,  comments Daniel Inocente, SOM Senior Designer for the study	923	en
304	362	We looked at the manufacturing constraints and used our analysis to interpolate a web pattern that followed the angular limits of the 3D printing machines	923	en
305	363	The cross section and thickness was also analysed and differentiated to reduce the overall mass – with reduced thickness at the exterior/interior boundaries	923	en
306	364	This was a great opportunity to show the potential of our technology for the fabrication of lightweight metal structures together with ESA and SOM,  explains Gijs van der Velden, CEO of MX3D	923	en
307	365	It was a perfect project for MX3D to leverage its experience in printing topology optimised metal structures	923	en
308	366	Achieving an optimal use of material is a company goal at MX3D because – just as when designing space applications – every reduced kilo in a MX3D design is a direct win for a project’s feasibility	923	en
309	367	Advenit Makaya, Advanced Manufacturing Engineer at ESA says:  This is a remarkable achievement from MX3D, which further highlights the potential of this additive manufacturing technique for an increasing range of space applications	923	en
310	368	The design flexibility and the possibility to combine the printed structure with embedded monitoring systems – as demonstrated in the 3D-printed bridge in Amsterdam – are worth investigating for applications in space structures	923	en
311	369	This technique could also be considered for in-situ construction of infrastructure during sustainable exploration missions, for instance by using metallic feedstock derived from the locally available regolith	923	en
312	370	Thomas Rohr, Head of the Materials and Processes team at ESA adds:  The capabilities of MX3D demonstrate inspiring concurrence of engineering and art, and are another great example to what extent additive manufacturing has already entered our society	923	en
313	371	For space applications, such technologies not only provide improvements in performance but can lead to unprecedented and enabling design solutions	923	en
314	372	This prototype was not able to be exhibited at SOM’s Biennale show, entitled ‘Life Beyond Earth’, but shows the scale of the four-storey semi-inflated habitat the company has devised for their design study of future lunar settlement	923	en

354	412	The palace was remodelled after 1486 by a follower of Pietro Lombardo for the patrician Giovanni Dario, Secretary to the Venetian Senate, diplomat, and merchant.[2] After Dario's death in 1494, it passed to his daughter, Marietta, who was married to Vincenzo Barbaro, the son of Giacomo Barbaro and owner of the neighboring Palazzo Barbaro Wolkoff	1110	en
355	413	Marietta's sons received possession of the house in 1522	1110	en

3323	1607	PREVIOUS MEMORIES The Campo in Venice is the wide part of the public road which in all other parts of the world is called Piazza	3960	it
3324	1608	The only squares in Venice are Piazza San Marco and Piazzale Roma	3960	it
3325	1609	In these open spaces, the boys find themselves after school to play, very often even with the ball, even if the Urban Police Regulations would prohibit its carrying out.	3960	it
3326	1610	The Field definition is not accidental	3960	it
3327	1611	Indeed, in ancient times, vegetables were grown in these areas as in any other countryside	3960	it
3328	1612	Even the farthest part of St. Mark's Square from St. Mark's Basilica was formerly a cultivated field	3960	it
3329	1613	Fruit trees grew in the field and numerous crops were planted	3960	it
3330	1614	The diminutive of Campo is Campiello, in the sense of a small field	3960	it
3331	1615	The topography of the city is very simple as a whole	3960	it
3332	1616	Near a church, usually in front of, but not necessarily, there is the field	3960	it
3333	1617	If there is no church in the Campo, surely this one was there before Napoleon's arrival in Venice, but it was demolished by the invader.	3960	it
3334	1618	Some examples: Campo Sant'Agostin, Campo San Stin, Campo Santa Maria Nova, Campo San Boldo, Campo Manin, Campo Sant'Angelo	3960	it
3335	1619	The church, in most cases, places the main façade projecting over the river, so that any function, Baptism, Marriage, Funeral or the feast of the Patron Saint, allowed access from the main entrance to guests who could arrive with their own private boats to function	3960	it
